      <h1>About Me</h1>   
      <article class="leftt">
        <h2>Snapshot</h2>
        <p>
          I am an experienced data engineer, consultant, and support specialist, with a
          passion for data. Vast troves of it exist already, and it is being
          recorded in ever increasing amounts. I believe that the understanding
          and use of data has almost infinite possibilities today, and I am
          highly motivated to continue to discover them for the betterment of
          you, me, and the world around us. I have experience with database management and engineering using SQL and Informatica; web development with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and python-django; and data analysis with Microsoft Azure, python, and Tableau. 
          I have a strong background in database management
          and technical support, using my statistical, mathematical, and
          technical expertise to serve those around me. Currently, I am working
          towards a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Brigham Young University.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in a small town called
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_Harbor,_Washington"
            target="_blank"
            >Gig Harbor, Washington.</a
          >
          Located just an hour southwest of Seattle, I grew up in a small,
          ocean-front town that was surrounded by greenery and beauty that is
          unmatched. I spent most of my childhood outdoors, which included
          camping, hiking, cycling, and running just to name a few. I was
          fortunate enough to have been raised into a wonderful family of five
          and I will always be grateful for the support and many opportunities
          that I was provided. In school, the subjects of math and science were
          always my favorite, and after enrolling as a student at Brigham Young
          University, I knew that I ought to pursue a career in a related field.
          After exploring many different STEM majors, I came across the
          Information Systems program and quickly realized that this was the
          path for me. I anticipate graduating in the year 2023 and I am particularly interested in the
          field of data engineering and science. I love almost anything that involves being in
          the outdoors! During high school, I participated in cross country and
          road cycling, both of which I still enjoy doing regularly. I also
          enjoy camping and hiking, and I have most recently spent the most time
          rock climbing. In my free time, I like to play the acoustic and bass
          guitar with friends.
